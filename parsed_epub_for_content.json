And although, according to her judgment, there be not any thing in it contrary to the Word of God, or to sound doctrine, or which a godly man may not with a good conscience use and submit unto, or which is not fairly defensible, if allowed such just and favourable construction as in common equity ought to be allowed to all human writings; yet upon the principles already laid down, it cannot but be supposed that further alterations would in time be found expedient. Accordingly, a Commission for a review was issued in the year 1689: but this great and good work miscarried at that time; and the Civil Authority has not since thought proper to revive it by any new Commission.</p>\r\n\r\n  <p>But when in the course of Divine Providence, these American States became independent with respect to civil government, their ecclesiastical independence was necessarily included; and the different religious denominations of Christians in these States were left at full and equal liberty to model and organize their respective Churches, and forms of worship, and discipline, in such manner as they might judge most convenient for their future prosperity; consistently with the constitution and laws of their country.</p>\r\n\r\n  <p>The attention of this Church was in the first place drawn to those alterations in the Liturgy which became necessary in the prayers for our Civil Rulers, in consequence of the Revolution. And the principal care herein was to make them conformable to what ought to be the proper end of all such prayers, namely, that \u201cRulers may have grace, wisdom, and understanding to execute justice, and to maintain truth\u201d; and that the people \u201cmay lead quiet and peaceable lives, in all godliness and honesty.\u201d</p>\r\n\r\n  <p>But while these alterations were in review before the Convention, they could not but, with gratitude to God, embrace the happy occasion which was offered to them (uninfluenced and unrestrained by any worldly authority whatsoever) to take a further review of the Public Service, and to establish such other alterations and amendments therein as might be deemed expedient.</p>\r\n\r\n  <p>It seems unnecessary to enumerate all the different alterations and amendments. They will appear, and it is to be hoped, the reasons of them also, upon a comparison of this with the Book of Common Prayer of the Church of England. In which it will also appear that this Church is far from intending to depart from the Church of England in any essential point of doctrine, discipline, or worship; or further than local circumstances require.</p>\r\n\r\n  <p>And now, this important work being brought to a conclusion, it is hoped the whole will be received and examined by every true member of our Church, and every sincere Christian, with a meek, candid, and charitable frame of mind; without prejudice or pre possessions; seriously considering what Christianity is, and what the truths of the Gospel are; and earnestly beseeching Almighty God to accompany with his blessing every endeavour for promulgating them to mankind in the clearest, plainest, most affecting and majestic manner, for the sake of Jesus Christ, our blessed Lord and Saviour.</p>\r\n\r\n  <p>Philadelphia, October, 1789.</p>\r\n</body>\r\n</html>\r\n",

And the disciples went, and did as Jesus commanded them, and brought the ass, and the colt, and put on them their clothes, and they set him thereon. And a very great multitude spread their garments in the way; others cut down branches from the trees, and strawed them in the way. And the multitudes that went before, and that followed, cried, saying, Hosanna to the son of David: Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord; Hosanna in the highest. And when he was come into Jerusalem, all the city was moved, saying, Who is this? And the multitude said, This is Jesus the prophet of Nazareth of Galilee. And Jesus went into the temple of God, and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the money-changers, and the seats of them that sold doves, and said unto them, It is written, My house shall be called the house of prayer; but ye have made it a den of thieves.</p>\r\n</body>\r\n</html>\r\n",

For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead. For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive. But every man in his own order: Christ the firstfruits; afterward they that are Christ\u2019s at his coming. Then cometh the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power. For he must reign, till he hath put all enemies under his feet. The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death. For he hath put all things under his feet. But when he saith all things are put under him, it is manifest that he is excepted, which did put all things under him. And when all things shall be subdued unto him, then shall the Son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all.</p>\r\n\r\n  <p>But some man will say, How are the dead raised up? and with what body do they come? Thou foolish one, that which thou sowest is not quickened, except it die: and that which thou sowest, thou sowest not that body that shall be, but bare grain, it may chance of wheat, or of some other grain: but God giveth it a body as it hath pleased him, and to every seed its own body. All flesh is not the same flesh: but there is one kind of flesh of men, another flesh of beasts, another of fishes, and another of birds. There are also celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial: but the glory of the celestial is one, and the glory of the terrestrial is another. There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars: for one star differeth from another star in glory. So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption: it is sown in dishonour; it is raised in glory: it is sown in weakness; it is raised in power: it is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body. And so it is written, The first man Adam was made a living soul; the last Adam was made a quickening spirit. Howbeit that was not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural; and afterward that which is spiritual. The first man is of the earth, earthy: the second man is the Lord from heaven. As is the earthy, such are they also that are earthy: and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly. And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly.</p>\r\n\r\n  <p>Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption. Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed. For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality. So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory. O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory? The sting of death is sin; and the strength of sin is the law. But thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ. Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord.</p>\r\n\r\n  <ul>\r\n    <li><i>Or this.</i></li>\r\n  </ul>\r\n\r\n  <p class=\"centered\"><i>Romans</i> viii.&nbsp;14.</p>\r\n\r\n  <p>AS many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God. For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father. The Spirit himself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God: and if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together. For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us. For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God. We know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose. What shall we then say to these things? If God be for us, who can be against us? He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things? Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died, yea rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us. Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us. For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.</p>\r\n\r\n  <ul>\r\n    <li><i>Or this.</i></li>\r\n  </ul>\r\n\r\n  <p class=\"centered\"><i>St. John</i> xiv.&nbsp;1.</p>\r\n\r\n  <p>JESUS said, Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe also in me.

Fill my memory with the words of thy Law; enlighten my understanding with the illumination of the Holy Ghost; and may all the wishes and desires of my will centre in what thou hast commanded. And, to make me instrumental in promoting the salvation of the people now committed to my charge, grant that I may faithfully administer thy holy Sacraments, and by my life and doctrine set forth thy true and lively Word. Be ever with me in the performance of all the duties of my ministry: in prayer, to quicken my devotion; in praises, to heighten my love and gratitude; and in preaching, to give a readiness of thought and expression suitable to the clearness and excellency of thy holy Word.

And especially to this Congregation present, give the abundance of thy grace; that with one heart they may desire the prosperity of thy holy Apostolic Church, and with one mouth may profess the faith once delivered to the Saints. Defend them from the sins of heresy and schism; let not the foot of pride come nigh to hurt them, nor the hand of the ungodly to cast them down. And grant that the course of this world may be so peaceably ordered by thy governance, that thy Church may joyfully serve thee in all godly quietness; that so they may walk in the ways of truth and peace, and at last be numbered with thy Saints in glory everlasting; through the merits of the same thy blessed Son Jesus Christ, the gracious Bishop and Shepherd of our souls, who liveth and reigneth with thee and the same Holy Ghost, one God, world without end.

N.</p>\r\n\r\n  <p class=\"versicle\"><i>Question.</i> Who gave you this Name?</p>\r\n\r\n  <p class=\"psalm\"><i>Answer.</i> My Sponsors in Baptism; wherein I was made a member of Christ, the child of God, and an inheritor of the kingdom of heaven.</p>\r\n\r\n  <p class=\"versicle\"><i>Question.</i> What did your Sponsors then for you?</p>\r\n\r\n  <p class=\"psalm\"><i>Answer.</i> They did promise and vow three things in my name: First, that I should renounce the devil and all his works, the pomps and vanity of this wicked world, and all the sinful lusts of the flesh; Secondly, that I should believe all the Articles of the Christian Faith; And Thirdly, that I should keep God\u2019s holy will and commandments, and walk in the same all the days of my life.</p>\r\n\r\n  <p class=\"versicle\"><i>Question.</i> Dost thou not think that thou art bound to believe, and to do, as they have promised for thee?</p>\r\n\r\n  <p class=\"psalm\"><i>Answer.</i> Yes, verily; and by God\u2019s help so I will.

Thou shalt have none other gods but me.</p>\r\n\r\n  <p class=\"versicle\">II. Thou shalt not make to thyself any graven image, nor the likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or in the earth beneath, or in the water under the earth; thou shalt not bow down to them, nor worship them; for I the <span class=\"smallcaps\">Lord</span> thy God am a jealous God, and visit the sins of the fathers upon the children, unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me; and show mercy unto thousands in them that love me and keep my commandments.</p>\r\n\r\n  <p class=\"versicle\">III.

Remember that thou keep holy the Sabbath-day. Six days shalt thou labour, and do all that thou hast to do; but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the <span class=\"smallcaps\">Lord</span> thy God. In it thou shalt do no manner of work; thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, thy man-servant, and thy maid-servant, thy cattle, and the stranger that is within thy gates. For in six days the <span class=\"smallcaps\">Lord</span> made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the <span class=\"smallcaps\">Lord</span> blessed the seventh day, and hallowed it.</p>\r\n\r\n  <p class=\"versicle\">V.

Let me hear, therefore, if thou canst say the Lord\u2019s Prayer.</p>\r\n\r\n  <p class=\"psalm\"><i>Answer.</i> Our Father, who art in heaven, Hallowed be thy Name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done, On earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our trespasses, As we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation, But deliver us from evil. Amen.</p>\r\n\r\n  <p class=\"versicle\"><i>Question.</i> What desirest thou of God in this Prayer?</p>\r\n\r\n  <p class=\"psalm\"><i>Answer.</i> I desire my Lord God, our heavenly Father, who is the giver of all goodness, to send his grace unto me, and to all people; that we may worship him, serve him, and obey him, as we ought to do. And I pray unto God, that he will send us all things that are needful both for our souls and bodies; and that he will be merciful unto us, and forgive us our sins; and that it will please him to save and defend us in all dangers both of soul and body; and that he will keep us from all sin and wickedness, and from our spiritual enemy, and from everlasting death. And this I trust he will do of his mercy and goodness, through our Lord Jesus Christ. And therefore I say, Amen, So be it.</p>\r\n\r\n  <p class=\"versicle\"><i>Question.</i> How many Sacraments hath Christ ordained in his Church?</p>\r\n\r\n  <p class=\"psalm\"><i>Answer.</i> Two only, as generally necessary to salvation; that is to say, Baptism, and the Supper of the Lord.</p>\r\n\r\n  <p class=\"versicle\"><i>Question.</i> What meanest thou by this word Sacrament?</p>\r\n\r\n  <p class=\"psalm\"><i>Answer.</i> I mean an outward and visible sign of an inward and spiritual grace given unto us; ordained by Christ himself, as a means whereby we receive the same, and a pledge to assure us thereof.</p>\r\n\r\n  <p class=\"versicle\"><i>Question.</i> How many parts are there in a Sacrament?</p>\r\n\r\n  <p class=\"psalm\"><i>Answer.</i> Two; the outward visible sign, and the inward spiritual grace.</p>\r\n\r\n  <p class=\"versicle\"><i>Question.</i> What is the outward visible sign or form in Baptism?</p>\r\n\r\n  <p class=\"psalm\"><i>Answer.</i> Water; wherein the person is baptized, In the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.</p>\r\n\r\n  <p class=\"versicle\"><i>Question.</i> What is the inward and spiritual grace?</p>\r\n\r\n  <p class=\"psalm\"><i>Answer.</i> A death unto sin, and a new birth unto righteousness: for being by nature born in sin, and the children of wrath, we are hereby made the children of grace.</p>\r\n\r\n  <p class=\"versicle\"><i>Question.</i> What is required of persons to be baptized?</p>\r\n\r\n  <p class=\"psalm\"><i>Answer.</i> Repentance, whereby they forsake sin; and Faith, whereby they stedfastly believe the promises of God made to them in that Sacrament.</p>\r\n\r\n  <p class=\"versicle\"><i>Question.</i> Why then are Infants baptized, when by reason of their tender age they cannot perform them?</p>\r\n\r\n  <p class=\"psalm\"><i>Answer.</i> Because they promise them both by their Sureties; which promise, when they come to age, themselves are bound to perform.</p>\r\n\r\n  <p class=\"versicle\"><i>Question.</i> Why was the Sacrament of the Lord\u2019s Supper ordained?</p>\r\n\r\n  <p class=\"psalm\"><i>Answer.</i> For the continual remembrance of the sacrifice of the death of Christ, and of the benefits which we receive thereby.</p>\r\n\r\n  <p class=\"versicle\"><i>Question.</i> What is the outward part or sign of the Lord\u2019s Supper?</p>\r\n\r\n  <p class=\"psalm\"><i>Answer.</i> Bread and Wine, which the Lord hath commanded to be received.</p>\r\n\r\n  <p class=\"versicle\"><i>Question.</i> What is the inward part, or thing signified?</p>\r\n\r\n  <p class=\"psalm\"><i>Answer.</i> The Body and Blood of Christ, which are spiritually taken and received by the faithful in the Lord\u2019s Supper.</p>\r\n\r\n  <p class=\"versicle\"><i>Question.</i> What are the benefits whereof we are partakers thereby?</p>\r\n\r\n  <p class=\"psalm\"><i>Answer.</i> The strengthening and refreshing of our souls by the Body and Blood of Christ, as our bodies are by the Bread and Wine.</p>\r\n\r\n  <p class=\"versicle\"><i>Question.</i> What is required of those who come to the Lord\u2019s Supper?</p>\r\n\r\n  <p class=\"psalm\"><i>Answer.</i> To examine themselves, whether they repent them truly of their former sins, stedfastly purposing to lead a new life; have a lively faith in God\u2019s mercy through Christ, with a thankful remembrance of his death; and be in charity with all men.</p>\r\n\r\n  <ul>\r\n    <li><i>The Minister of every Parish shall diligently, upon Sundays and Holy Days, or on some other convenient occasions, openly in the Church, instruct or examine so many Children of his Parish, sent unto him, as he shall think convenient, in some part of this Catechism.</i></li>\r\n\r\n    <li><i>And all Fathers, Mothers, Masters, and Mistresses, shall cause their Children, Servants, and Apprentices, who have not learned their Catechism, to come to the Church at the time appointed, and obediently to hear and to be ordered by the Minister, until such time as they have learned all that is here appointed for them to learn.</i></li>\r\n\r\n    <li><i>So soon as Children are come to a competent age, and can say the Creed, the Lord\u2019s Prayer, and the Ten Commandments, and can answer to the other questions of this short Catechism, they shall be brought to the Bishop.</i></li>\r\n\r\n    <li><i>And whensoever the Bishop shall give knowledge for Children to be brought unto him for their Confirmation, the Minister of every Parish shall either bring, or send in writing, with his hand subscribed thereunto, the Names of all such Persons within his Parish, as he shall think it to be presented to the Bishop to be confirmed.</i></li>\r\n  </ul>\r\n</body>\r\n</html>\r\n",
